Canary is an experimental language translation daemon designed to seamlessly integrate with Git and Gemini, providing high-quality, automated translations for your applications.

By continuously monitoring your language source files, Canary generates up-to-date translations in real time. This ensures that, by the time you're ready to commit your changes, your application is already translated and ready for deployment.
